## Contributing

I hope to expand this class to include other functions.  If you'd like to
contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch.  I am new to
gitHub and am eager to receive a Pull request to learn how it is done.

I am also open to feedback about how well I am being compliant with standards
and "best practices."  I have written software solo for years, and am trying to
learn how to work better with others.
